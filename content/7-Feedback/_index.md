### Overall Evaluation

**1. Working Environment**  
The work environment is friendly, and the mentors are sociable and supportive. They are always willing to help me if I have any problems.The workspace is tidy and comfortable, helping me focus better. However, I think it would be better to have more social gatherings or team bonding activities on a regular basis to strengthen the relationship.


**2. Support from Mentor / Team Admin**  
The mentor provides very detailed guidance, explains clearly when I don’t understand, and always encourages me to ask questions. The admin team supports administrative tasks, provides necessary documents, and creates favorable conditions for me to work effectively. I especially appreciate that the mentor allows me to try and solve problems myself instead of just giving the answer.

**3. Relevance of Work to Academic Major**  
The tasks I was assigned align well with the knowledge I learned at university, while also introducing me to new areas I had never encountered before. This allowed me to both strengthen my foundational knowledge and gain practical skills.

**4. Learning & Skill Development Opportunities**  
During the internship, I learned many new skills such as using project management tools, teamwork skills, and professional communication in a corporate environment. The mentor also shared valuable real-world experiences that helped me better plan my career path.

**5. Company Culture & Team Spirit**  
The company culture is very positive: everyone respects each other, works seriously but still keeps things enjoyable. When there are urgent projects, everyone works together and supports one another regardless of their position. This made me feel like a real part of the team, even as an intern.

**6. Internship Policies / Benefits**  
The company often provides me with opportunities to connect with other mentors to improve my networking. Additionally, I've learned communication skills – which has helped me become more confident in communicating with colleagues, something I wasn't able to do before.

## Track 1 : Gen AI and Data

### Summary Report: “Building a Unified Data Foundation on AWS for AI and Analytics Workloads”

#### Event Objectives
- Share strategies and best practices for constructing a unified, scalable data foundation
- Tailor data infrastructure to support AI and analytics workloads
- Leverage AWS services to create a robust environment for modern applications
- Cover key components including data ingestion, storage, processing, and governance
- Enable effective data management for advanced analytics and AI initiatives

### Speakers

- **Kien Nguyen** – Solutions Architect, AWS

### Key Highlights

#### The Rise of Agentic AI

- Moving from Chatbot -> Agentic Systems (autonomous, multi-agent, mimicking human logic).
- 15% of day-to-day work decisions will be made autonomously by AI in 2028

#### Amazon Bedrock AgentCore

- **Security**: Deploy agents securely at scale with enterprise-grade controls.
- **Capabilities**: Enhance agents with Tools (APIs) to take action and Memory to retain customer context.
- **Observability**: Full visibility to monitor agent reasoning and actions.

### Key Takeaways

#### Strategic Mindset

- **Autonomy over Automation**: The goal is to build systems that can independently achieve goals, not just automate repetitive tasks 
- **Risk Awareness**: Innovation must go hand-in-hand with risk controls and clear business value definition. 

#### Technical Architecture

- **Vector Search**: Is the backbone of AI memory; essential for RAG workflows.
- **Multi-Agent Systems**: The future lies in specialized agents collaborating (e.g., Guardian Agent + FAQ Agent).   

### Applying to Work

- **Assess Data Readiness** Evaluate current databases for Vector Search compatibility to support AI memory. 
- **Define Risk Controls**: Establish governance policies for AI prompts and responses before scaling. 
- **Try Bedrock**: Start experimenting with AgentCore to build a prototype with simple tool integration. 

### Event Experience

Attending the **“Building a Unified Data Foundation on AWS for AI and Analytics Workloads”** workshop was extremely valuable, giving me a comprehensive view of modernizing applications and databases using advanced methods and tools. Key experiences included:

#### Learning from market insights
- Understood the **urgency** of adoption: Gartner predicts **33%** of software will use Agentic AI by 2028.
- Learned why **40%** of projects might fail (cost, risk controls) and how to avoid these pitfalls.

#### Technical visualization
- Visualized the architecture of **Agentic Systems**: How agents perceive, reason, and act autonomously.
- Saw the direct connection between **Data Strategy** (Vector DBs) and **Agent Capabilities** (Memory).

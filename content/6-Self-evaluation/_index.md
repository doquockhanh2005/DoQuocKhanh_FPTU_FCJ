During my internship at **First Cloud Journey program** from **08/09/2025** to **09/12/2025**, I had the opportunity to learn about cloud technologies and apply what I learned to various projects. I explored AWS services and joined workshops, which helped me gain a deeper understanding of Cloud. Additionally, I had the chance to connect with more people.

In terms of work ethic, I always strived to complete tasks well, complied with workplace regulations, and actively engaged with colleagues to improve work efficiency.

To objectively reflect on my internship period, I would like to evaluate myself based on the following criteria:
